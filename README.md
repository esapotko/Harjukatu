# [Harjukatu](http://potkonen.dy.fi/)
# Web application and Linux server (Ubuntu) playground project at my home PC
## Dynamic web application. Just HTML/CSS/REST/SQL
- NetBeans
- WorkBench
## Manageable server
- MySQL. WorkBench as UI
- CI tools. Git, Maven, Java. Full integration through Netbeans (Allmost anything, Workbench needed rarely).
- NGinx Loadbalancing (Caching, OAuth2, LDAP is in future plans [config must fit into one page]).
- Consolidated logging through syslog. Graylog, Elasticsearch, Mongo
- Services managed by systemctl.
